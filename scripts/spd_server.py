.. module:: Node_C
   :platform: Unix
   :synopsis: This ROS node manages robot goal setting and status monitoring by receiving user inputs, and handling feedback and odometry data.

.. moduleauthor:: younes

This node subscribes to the following topics:
    - /odom (nav_msgs/Odometry)
        Receives the robot's instantaneous position and velocity.
    - /reaching_goal/goal (assignment_2_2023/PlanningActionGoal)
        Receives the last goal target chosen by the user.

And provides the following service:
    - /speed_distance (assignment_2_2023/Avrg)
        Provides the average speed and distance of the robot from the goal.
